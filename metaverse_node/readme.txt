metaverse_node is a drupal module. It lets drupal nodes have virtual world location information. Think of it as the location module for virtual worlds.

metaverse_node is copyright 2010 by Paul Mitchum. It is released under the GPL.

metaverse_node adds Grid and Region node types, in addition to piggybacking location info to all nodes. This means that, for instance, Region nodes could be organic groups, and any node with virtual world information could be mapped on a grid map.

Extensive views integration already exists, but there is always room for improvement.
