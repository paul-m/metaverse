metaverse basically replaces the secondlife module.
it allows for more grids than just secondlife.

You set up grids, each with a name, a machine-readable name,
and a comma-separated list of allowed IPs.

Each grid can be switched on or off, allowing or disallowing access from that grid.

llHTTPRequest sends an X-Secondlife-Shard header which gives the grid. ReactionGrid for ReactionGrid, and 'Production' for Second Life (booo.)
