metaverse_user is a drupal module. It requires the metaverse module. It lets you make users in drupal that have associated avatars in virtual worlds like Second Life and OpenSimulator.

This module is based on SLUser by ssm2017binder. The parts that are his are his, of course, and the parts that aren't are copyright 2010 by Paul Mitchum.

This software is released to the universe under the GPL.

metaverse_user module is more of a framework than not. It gives users a rudimentary UI for changing their avatar UUID and associated grid.

Other modules can extend it, to provide fancy authentication modes. metaverse_user will be the solid core around which those other modules orbit, in rapturous obesiance.
