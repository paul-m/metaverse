the metaverse_user drupal module

WHAT IS METAVERSE_USER?

An abstraction of the SlUser module created by ssm2017binder. I wanted to create a more flexible version that would still be somewhat compatible with the previous version.

metaverse_user module only keeps parity between the drupal user and the SL user. Other modules use it. It only adds forms to the user profile.

The previous version had an elaborate in-world validation scheme. My needs were somewhat different.
